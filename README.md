# msdevrgb-web2018-demo

Demo code derived during the talk about Web Development 2018 at the Microsoft Developer Group in Regensburg.

## Requirements

You will need a working version of Node.js on your machine. In the best case you already installed TypeScript and Yarn globally as well. If not then you can still do it via:

```bash
npm i typescript yarn -g
```

The dependencies in the project can then be installed via:

```bash
yarn install
```

All commands should be run with the repository being the current working directory.

## Building and Running

Building the application can be done via

```bash
yarn build
```

Alternatively, if you want to run it already during development prefer calling

```bash
yarn start
```

It will run an instance of webpack-dev-server.
